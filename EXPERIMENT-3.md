# Wireshark

# Aim:

To capture, analyze, and troubleshoot network traffic using Wireshark for network monitoring and forensic investigation.

# Tools / Features

• Packet Capture – Captures live traffic from interfaces (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.).

• Protocol Analysis – Supports 2000+ protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, SSL, etc.).

• Filters – Apply capture filters and display filters for specific traffic.

• Packet Dissection – Shows details like source/destination IP, ports, flags.

• Stream Follow – Reconstructs TCP/UDP streams for analysis.

• Export Data – Save captured packets in .pcap format for later use.

• Statistics – Provides I/O graphs, flow diagrams, and protocol hierarchy.

# Procedure

1. Launch Wireshark → Open the tool with administrator rights.

2. Select Interface → Choose the network adapter (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.).

3. Start Capture → Click the blue shark icon (start capturing packets).

4. Apply Filters → Use filters (e.g., http, ip.addr == 192.168.1.1, tcp.port == 80) to focus on traffic.

5. Analyze Packets → Select a packet to view details in three panes (summary, details, raw data).

6. Follow Stream → Right-click → Follow → TCP Stream (to see conversation).

7. Save Capture → Stop capture and save as .pcap for reporting.
